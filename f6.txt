Similarly, the editorial process of the movie was a process of discovery and it was not possible if they would not have opened completely to what all they received from different sources. The movie is a striking example of what happens when creativity and idealism collide. It’s a part vision of how lots of different people doing lots of different things form a global community. These may be some of the idealistic thoughts and factors, based on which the movie was successfully produced.
